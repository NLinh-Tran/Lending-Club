# Lending Club Credit Modeling & Portfolio Optimization

Welcome to my Project! 

This is a deep dive into Lending Club's data to uncover patterns, challenges, and opportunities that can inform future decision-making. As a pre-junior majoring in Business Analytics and Finance, I built this project to apply my curiosity in a real-world setting - bridging analytical thinking with business impact.

## Project Overview
Lending Club, a pioneer in peer-to-peer lending, revolutionized consumer credit by enabling retail and institutional investors to fund personal loans directly. 

While this innovation unlocked new growth opportunities, it also introduced significant risk exposure due to borrower quality variance, macroeconomic sensitivity, and underwriting scalability.

This project combines Lending Club’s business-focused analysis with predictive modeling to explore how approval decisions, borrower traits, and risk factors interact over time. 

The dataset includes both accepted and rejected loans issued between 2007 and 2018, offering a comprehensive view of Lending Club’s lending strategy over more than a decade.

## Project Objective
* Investigate the drivers of portfolio losses and surface high-risk borrower segments
* Flag early warning signals within grace period loans to support proactive risk mitigation
* Evaluate risk-adjusted profitability across borrower segments to inform pricing and approval strategy
* Develop a Loan Approval Pre-screener model to simulate loan acceptance decisions and evaluate trade-offs between approval volume and portfolio risk
* Develop a Loan Charge-off Risk Model focused on precision, used to flag high-default borrowers at origination
